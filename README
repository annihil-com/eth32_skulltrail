Installation Notes:

1.) Extract contents from the hack folder and create a NEW folder outside the ET Root Directory.

3.) Now move The pk3 file called "eth32_st.pk3" and place inside your ETMAIN folder. 

4.) Point the eth32.exe loader to ET.exe and Go Rage All! :)

5.) The Gui Menu to tweak settings is F9 as always! :) 

Source is INCLUDED for developer's needs as i won't take time to occupy the public release of this project anymore.

**Note** Anti-Cheat Code like punkbuster stuff was deleted not to mention the Built - In Screenshot Removal Utility for punkbuster images is gone from both the hack and source files included!

These features will remain in the PRIVATE version.
